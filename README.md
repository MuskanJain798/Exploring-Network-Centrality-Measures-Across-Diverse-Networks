# Exploring-Network-Centrality-Measures-Across-Diverse-Networks
## Problem Statement:
The primary objective is to analyze network centrality measures, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, page rank centrality, and clustering coefficient, across different types of networks. By conducting this analysis, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and correlations within each network and between different networks. Additionally, we seek to understand how network characteristics influence centrality measures.

## Methods and Findings:

Wikipedia Voting Network: This directed network represents Wikipedia users and their voting interactions. Key findings include the distribution of degree centrality, with higher values concentrated in the network's center. Out-degree centrality is more concentrated than in-degree centrality. Other centrality measures, such as closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, provide distinct insights into the network's structure./n
Paper Co-Authorship Network: This undirected network covers papers from January 1993 to April 2003 and focuses on scientific collaborations. Degree centrality is concentrated in the network's center. Other centrality measures, including betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality, offer unique perspectives on influential authors and paper collaborations./n
Facebook Social Network: This undirected social network comprises 'friends lists' or 'circles' from Facebook. Centrality analysis reveals less pronounced patterns, with degree centrality providing limited defining nodes. Betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality offer valuable insights into the network's structure./n
Heatmaps and Correlations: Heatmaps and correlation analyses help identify relationships between centrality measures within each network. These visualizations aid in understanding how different measures interact and complement each other
